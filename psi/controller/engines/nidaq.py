    # when the acquisition card needs additional samples, NI-DAQmx will transfer
    # the next chunk of data from the computer memory). We can overwrite data
    # that's been buffered in computer memory (e.g., so we can insert a target
    # in response to a nose-poke). However, we cannot overwrite data that's
    # already been transfered to the onboard buffer. So, the onboard buffer size
